    "App data should be scoped to shops located in Bangalore (shop directory + item availability per shop).",

    "Support Women inventory items with richer subcategory taxonomy (e.g., Indo-Western Fusion, Celebration & Festive Sets, Contemporary Ethnic Workwear, Ready-to-Wear (Pre-Draped), Sustainable Handloom) and allow storing/displaying trend color + non-floral pattern attributes."
