  "summary": "The diff does not show evidence that the requested new seeded red floral shirt item and its required static image asset were added. The diff also appears to introduce backend blob-storage/photo attachment functionality that was not requested in REQ-29/REQ-30.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-29",
      "requirement": "Add one additional seeded shirt item with color=\"Red\" and pattern=\"Floral\" to the backend initial dataset in `backend/main.mo` (`_initializeShops`), with a non-empty `photo` path under `/assets/generated/`, and ensure it appears in `searchItems(null, ?\"Shirt\", ?\"Red\", ?\"Floral\")` and has at least one shop in `getItemDetails`.",
      "reason": "The provided `backend/main.mo` diff is truncated inside `_initializeShops()` and does not show any newly added item with itemType=\"Shirt\", color=\"Red\", pattern=\"Floral\", nor a `photo` value matching the required asset path. Without that explicit content, implementation of the seeded item cannot be verified.",
      "evidence": [
        "backend/main.mo"

      "id": "REQ-30",
      "requirement": "Add a new static clothing photo file at `frontend/public/assets/generated/men_shirt_red_floral.dim_480x640.jpeg` and ensure the backend seeded item’s `photo` field is exactly `/assets/generated/men_shirt_red_floral.dim_480x640.jpeg`.",
      "reason": "The diff summary shows no added files (\"Added: 0\") and no `frontend/public/assets/generated/...` asset addition is listed, so the required image file is not present in the changes.",

      "description": "Added backend blob-storage integration and APIs for attaching and retrieving item photos (`attachPhotoToItem`, `getItemPhoto`) plus `itemPhotos` map and `MixinStorage` include.",
      "reason": "REQ-29/REQ-30 only request seeding one additional item and adding a static frontend image file. They do not request adding blob storage services or new photo upload/retrieval endpoints, and the BuildRequest constraints emphasize keeping backend as a single actor and adding a static asset under `frontend/public/assets/generated`.",
      "evidence": [
        "backend/main.mo (imports `blob-storage/Mixin`, `blob-storage/Storage`; `include MixinStorage()`; defines `itemPhotos`; adds `attachPhotoToItem` and `getItemPhoto`)"
