Implement suggestions as clickable controls that set the corresponding input state (and keep the existing free-text inputs). Compose existing shadcn/ui components (e.g., Button and existing Card/Input/Label usage) for the suggestion chips; do not edit anything under frontend/src/components/ui. Verify the component's usage instructions before implementing."
